      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>A tiny, fiery planet in the Outer Rim, Mustafar maintains an erratic orbit between two gas giants. Mustafar is
        rich in unique and valuable minerals which have long been mined by the Tech Union. Its lava pits and rivers make
        this planet a dangerous habitat; its natives have burly, tough bodies that can withstand extreme heat. The
        planet became the backdrop for the fateful duel between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. After the rise of
        the Empire, captured Jedi were brought to the volcanic world for interrogation and execution.</p>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>An idyllic world close to the border of the Outer Rim Territories, Naboo is inhabited by peaceful humans known
        as the Naboo, and an indigenous species of intelligent amphibians called the Gungans. Naboo's surface consists
        of swampy lakes, rolling plains and green hills. Its population centers are beautiful -- Naboo's river cities
        are filled with classical architecture and greenery, while the underwater Gungan settlements are a beautiful
        display of exotic hydrostatic bubble technology.</p>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Tatooine is harsh desert world orbiting twin suns in the galaxyâ€™s Outer Rim. In the days of the Empire and the
        Republic, many settlers scratched out a living on moisture farms, while spaceport cities such as Mos Eisley and
        Mos Espa served as home base for smugglers, criminals, and other rogues. Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker
        both once called Tatooine home, although across the stars it was more widely known as a hive of scum and
        villainy ruled by the crime boss Jabba the Hutt.</p>
