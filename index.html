      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Coruscant is the vibrant heart and capital of the galaxy during the age of the Empire, featuring a diverse mix
        of cultures and citizens spread over hundreds of levels. Once the home of the main Jedi Temple -- the central
        hub of Jedi training and learning for over a thousand generations and the repository of the Jedi Archives --
        these traditions ended when the planet bore witness to Order 66.</p>

      <h2>The Jedi Temple of Coruscant</h2>
      <p>Instantly recognizable by its distinctive crown of five spires, the Jedi Temple was the home of the Jedi Order on Coruscant.
        Part school and part monastery, the Jedi Temple was the central hub for all Jedi activities in the galaxy.
        When Supreme Chancellor Palpatine enacted Order 66, clone troops led by the newly risen Darth Vader attacked the temple, massacring its inhabitants and
        leaving the structure badly damaged. With the Empire triumphant, the Jedi Temple’s spires still rose into the Coruscant skies.
        But the building was now the Imperial Palace, home to the Sith Lord who had destroyed the Jedi.</p>

      <h2>The Senate</h2>
      <p>At the height of its rule, the Galactic Republic was governed by a body of Senators representing the many worlds of the galaxy.
        Within the cavernous Senate rotunda, hundreds of politicians would fill the viewing platforms that lined the curved walls.
        The Senate’s power gradually eroded after it voted emergency powers to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine during the Clone Wars,
        and the body was sharply divided between supporters of the war and those seeking peace. After Palpatine declared himself Emperor,
        power was increasingly wielded by regional governors. Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, Palpatine disbanded the Senate.</p>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>A tiny, fiery planet in the Outer Rim, Mustafar maintains an erratic orbit between two gas giants. Mustafar is
        rich in unique and valuable minerals which have long been mined by the Tech Union. Its lava pits and rivers make
        this planet a dangerous habitat; its natives have burly, tough bodies that can withstand extreme heat. The
        planet became the backdrop for the fateful duel between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. After the rise of
        the Empire, captured Jedi were brought to the volcanic world for interrogation and execution.</p>

      <h2>Vader's castle</h2>
      <p>An obsidian tower rising from the lava fields of Mustafar, Darth Vader’s personal redoubt sits
        above an ancient Sith cave that is a source of malignant power, as well as near the site of the former
        Anakin Skywalker’s maiming by Obi-Wan Kenobi. These twin connections help Vader channel his rage and pain into a focus for the dark side of the Force.
        After Vader’s death, the castle has become a pilgrimage site for cultists drawn to the Sith Lord’s legend.</p>

      <p>An idyllic world close to the border of the Outer Rim Territories, Naboo is inhabited by peaceful humans known
        as the Naboo, and an indigenous species of intelligent amphibians called the Gungans. Naboo's surface consists
        of swampy lakes, rolling plains and green hills. Its population centers are beautiful -- Naboo's river cities
        are filled with classical architecture and greenery, while the underwater Gungan settlements are a beautiful
        display of exotic hydrostatic bubble technology.</p>

      <h2>Lake retreat and Varykino Villa</h2>
      <p>Varykino Villa was located in Naboo's Lake Country on an island of the same name. The isolated estate was owned by the royal government and
        was used as a private refuge from the planet's capital Theed by several renowned members of the Naboo people.
        By the time of the Fall of the Republic the estate was maintained by the Naberrie family,
        offering Padmé Naberrie a secluded safe haven that she visited throughout her career as both the planet's Queen and senator.
        During the Separatist Crisis, Amidala hid away at Varykino with her Jedi protector Anakin Skywalker to escape an assassination plot. The two fell in love with each other
        during their time together and later married at the estate following the outbreak of the Clone Wars.</p>

        Republic, many settlers scratched out a living on moisture farms, while spaceport cities such as Mos Eisley and
        Mos Espa served as home base for smugglers, criminals, and other rogues. Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker
        both once called Tatooine home, although across the stars it was more widely known as a hive of scum and

      <p>Two generations of the Lars family sought to make a living on this hardscrabble farm on Tatooine,
        spending decades in the unforgiving climate coaxing moisture from the sandy planet's arid skies.
        Anakin Skywalker visited the farm in search of his mother Shmi, who’d married Cliegg Lars but been kidnapped by Tuskens.
        Later, Luke Skywalker grew up there, raised by Cliegg’s son Owen and his wife Beru while Obi-Wan Kenobi kept watch from afar.</p>
